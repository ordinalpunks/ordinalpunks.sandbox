happy to help with making ordinal punks recursive anyway i can ...
the ordinal punks "spritesheet" is about 100+ .PNGs ... now with the new recursive super-powers in ordinals  I recommend inscribing .PNGs one-by-one ...   (AND bonus no need for ord punk generator to inscribe in .js or whatever... use "plain" recursive .SVG/.HTML)
... that way you can inscribe over days or weeks or month ... and everybody can help  ... if an ordinal punk wants to make his / here punk recursive all that is required is to inscribe the .PNGs (each about 200 bytes) making up the punk ...


.. lets take ordinal punk no. 1
![](i/1.png)
as an example ...

... the base is robot (m) in 24x24px (.PNG) ...

![](i/base-m/robotmale.png)

.. the accessory is big beard (m) in 24x24 (.PNG) ...

![](i/accessories-m/bigbeard.png)

... that's it.

if you inscribe these two .PNGs ... than you can go recursive and inscribe your punk in .SVG  and "recurse" on the two inscriptions e.g.


``` svg
<svg width="100%" height="100%" image-rendering="pixelated" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <image width="100%" height="100%" href="/content/[inscribe_id]" />
  <image width="100%" height="100%" href="/content/[inscribe_id]" />
</svg>
```


.. lets try another ... take ordinal punk no. 93
![](i/93.png)

... the base is orc monster (m) in 24x24px (.PNG) ...

![](i/base-m/orcmale.png)

.. the accessories are eye mask (m) in 24x24 (.PNG) ...

![](i/accessories-m/eyemask.png)

.. and goatie (m) in 24x24 (.PNG) ...

![](i/accessories-m/goat.png)

.. and gold chain (m) in 24x24 (.PNG) ...

![](i/accessories-m/goldchain.png)

... that's it.

again if you inscribe these four .PNGs ... than you can go recursive and inscribe your punk in .SVG  and "recurse" on the four inscriptions.

``` svg
<svg width="100%" height="100%" image-rendering="pixelated" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <image width="100%" height="100%" href="/content/[inscribe_id]" />
  <image width="100%" height="100%" href="/content/[inscribe_id]" />
  <image width="100%" height="100%" href="/content/[inscribe_id]" />
  <image width="100%" height="100%" href="/content/[inscribe_id]" />
</svg>
```



... most of the 100+ .PNGs in ordinal punks are original ... meaning ... now that all 133 (?) .PNGs are inscribed for 10 000 recursive punks for (re) use ...  the cigarette, pipe, medical mask, top hat and some others .. big beard (!) ... can get (re)used and no need to reinscribe unless you want to own the "submodules" of your recursive ordinal punk(s).
